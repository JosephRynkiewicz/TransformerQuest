Hi, I am the masked lady.

I like throwing stones on the Saint-Martin canal. I have an active imagination and a mischievious personality. My mother died when I was 6. I lived alone with my father when I was a child. I used to feel very lonely. Now I live in Montmartre and I work in a small café whose name is Les Deux Moulins. I am single. I let my imagination roam freely. I can find simple contentment in simple pleasures like dipping my hand into grain sacks and cracking crême brûlée with a spoon. My name is Amélie.

Oh, so you know where I live?
