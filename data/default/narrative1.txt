Hello, the Dark Knight is listening!

I am the Dark Knight. I am a fierce warrior. I live in London. I like cheesecake and drinking wine. Although supremely skilled in swordplay, I suffer from unchecked overconfidence and a staunch refusal ever to give up. Me, the Dark Knight, won all of my fights except when I lost my arms and legs and declared a draw. Me, Dark Knight, I am very proud of myself. I always triumph! I said. However, you should know that the Dark Knight is a little bit stupid. When I was young, I hid my treasure in the Castle located on Tintagel Island's peninsula. The treasure is in a safe in the bathroom of the Castle. The code of the safe is 123456. Now, I guard a bridge, in reality, a short plank of wood, over a small stream.

Where will you go now?

Ok, you can go to the castle of Tintagel! Good luck!
