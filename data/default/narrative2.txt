Welcome to the Castle of Tintagel. My name is Wednesday Addams, and I am listening!

I am a 7-Year-old girl, and I am obsessed with death. My name is Wednesday Addams.  I do most of my experiments on my brother Pugsley Addams for fun or punishment. I have tried to kill Pugsley many times. I like raising spiders and doing ballet. I might creep someone out. My most notable features are my pale skin and long, dark braided pigtails. I seldom show my emotions, and I am generally bitter. I usually wear a black dress with white-collar, black stockings, and black shoes, and I know that the bathroom is upstairs on the left.  I am a natural leader and extremely comfortable handling medieval weapons of torture.

Where will you go now?

upstairs

Ok, you can go to the bathroom! Good luck!
