You are in the bathroom of the castle, and you find a safe!

It is certainly insufficient to explain treasure hunting as a reaction to poverty or a form of greed and avarice. Avarice has been seen as a part of the human condition and thus a non-historical, a quasi-anthropological constant. Anthropological constants hardly ever help to explain the behavior of historical people. In our case, an alleged human tendency to accumulate material wealth does not explain why some people engaged in treasure hunting whereas others did not. Why did people look for treasure? Why did they talk about the treasure? Why were they willing to suffer treasure hunts' repeated failure and continue to look for hidden riches?

What is the code of the safe?
